## Login and Sign Up

### Guardian and User related account dependency

- Guardian can have multiple Users but Users can only have one Guardian

- Once Guardian's gmail is logged in, it cannot be logged out unless game data was cleared

- When User's time runs out, other User can play by switching the account

## Game Mechanics

### Flow of the game

- A pre-test is conducted at the start of each theme/quarter and a post-test at the end of each quarter

- After the pre-test, the first level is unlocked. Each level passed, new levels will unlock. Last level will trigger the post-test

- After post-test, it unlocks a new quarter. When last quarter is reached, it is the end of the game

### Gameplay

- Most of the gaming control is basic. The controls are drag and drop or just by clicking

### Scoring

- User's data is stored and recorded to assess their development

## Game Development

### Assets and Game Objects

- Each developer has their own asset to avoid confusion and possible mistakes

- Each developer follows a standardized sizing and positioning guidelines for game objects to ensure consistency

- Images came from our UI Developer and voices came from our very own including other participant/s
